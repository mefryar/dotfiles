# dotfiles
Contains custom dotfiles. Right now these are just for configuring zsh and
git. This repo is cloned to the home directory so the path is `~/dotfiles/`.
The script `makesymlinks.sh` creates symbolic links from the home directory to
`~/dotfiles/`.

## Installation

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/mefryar/dotfiles.git
cd ~/dotfiles
./makesymlinks.sh
```

## Acknowledgments
This repo was inspired by (and draws heavily from) https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles
