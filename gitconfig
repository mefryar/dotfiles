# Note: I tried to figure out a way to conditionally include one file to
# specify my editor path if I'm on macOS and another file to specify my
# editor path if I'm on Windows. Specifically, I tried 
# [includeIf "gitdir:C:/Users/mifryar/"] for Windows. For macOs, I tried
# [includeIf "gitdir:/Users/mifryar/"] and [includeIf "gitdir:~/"].
# Since I couldn't get this to work, I'm going with the simpler solution
# of commenting out.

    editor = '/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl' -n -w
	excludesfile = /Users/mifryar/.gitignore
# 	editor = 'C:/Program Files/Sublime Text 3/sublime_text.exe' -n -w
